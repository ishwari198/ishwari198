- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, born in 1815, is often regarded as the world's first computer programmer. She wrote the first algorithm intended for implementation on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, a mechanical general-purpose computer. Her visionary ideas laid the foundation for modern computing. As a software engineer, I find inspiration in the pioneering contributions of Ada Lovelace to the world of programming! 💻👩‍💻
